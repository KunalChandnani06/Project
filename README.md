# Personal Portfolio - SCM Project

## 📚 Overview
This repository showcases the collaborative development of **personal portfolio websites** by a team of four students as part of the *Source Code Management* (SCM) course at Amity School of Engineering & Technology.

Each member created a unique, responsive, and interactive portfolio using:
- **HTML** for structure
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **JavaScript** for interactivity

The development process was version-controlled using **Git** with a structured branch strategy to simulate a real-world collaborative environment.

## 👥 Team Members
- **Kunal S Chandnani**
- **Shyamji Pandey**
- **Vedanth Aryan**
- **B Dharma Teja**

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Git & GitHub
- HTML5
- Tailwind CSS
- JavaScript
- Visual Studio Code (VS Code)

## 🌿 Branching Strategy
To ensure modular development, we followed a branch-per-feature strategy:
- `structure` – Handles HTML layout and responsiveness
- `styling` – Applies Tailwind CSS themes and designs
- `content` – Contains personal info, project data, social links
- `interactivity` – Implements animations, validation, and JS logic
- `main` – Merges stable features from all branches

## 🔁 Workflow
1. Clone the repository and switch to a dedicated feature branch
2. Make changes and commit with appropriate prefixes:
   - `[structure]`, `[styling]`, `[content]`, `[interactivity]`
3. Create Pull Requests for peer review
4. Merge changes into `main` after testing

## ✨ Features
- Fully **responsive** layout across devices
- Visually **customized themes**
- **JavaScript-powered** animations and validations
- SCM features like:
  - Commit hygiene
  - Merge protocols
  - Conflict resolution

## ⚠️ Challenges Faced
- Merge conflicts on shared files
- Coordinating folder structures while maintaining creative freedom
- Adapting to Git tools and workflows

## ✅ Outcomes
- Over **25–30 meaningful commits** by each member
- Improved understanding of **SCM practices**
- Fully functional and personalized portfolios
- Real-world experience with **collaborative version control**
